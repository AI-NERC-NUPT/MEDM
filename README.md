# MEDM
Minimal-Entropy Diversity Maximization for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation


On the largest domain-adaptation dataset VisDA-2017, MEDM-Res50 achieves 79.6% and MEDM-Res101 achieves 82.4% both in the mean accuracy, which might be the top-1 performing UDA algorithm as best as I know until the declaration of this code.
